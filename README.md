Abstract. The green HTTPS padlock located at the extreme left of the address bar of the browser on a website provides users with assurance about authentication of the server and the conﬁdentiality of the information that might be exchanged over the web page. It would seem that the HTTPS feature is now strongly undermined by cyber-attacks that use this functionality to abuse users trust. HTTPS would no longer guarantee full conﬁdentiality of data traﬃc on web pages at a time when even phishing websites have this layer of security on their website with certiﬁcates that they sign by themselves, thus putting users in total confusion. There exist many techniques to prevent phishing attacks (machine learning, various kinds of Hash function, Content Variation Similarity, Visual Perception Similarity, Url analysis etc.). In this paper, we integrate all these methods to propose a model based on similarity research of visual identity of web pages on a website as well as in its content variation in order to improve the level of detection of phishing attack. The model also integrates URL features extraction rules to help HTTPS better discriminate legitimate websites from phishing ones. Our algorithm spots phishing websites with an accuracy of 95%.
